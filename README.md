<h1>Very simple "banking system"</h1>

I probably was never past the novice level with regards to C++, so I now return by trying my hand at a beginner program.

This "banking system" is programed with C++ language and the system's information storage apparatus is an XML document to store accounts' information, in which I use **[Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com)** library to interface with XML files.
